Ordering links in challenges:

This project is designed to meet the following user story:

"As a coach,
So I my students can be lazy while enjoying a frequently updated progression from challenge to challenge,
I want to be able to have my links between challenges update based on the order in the challenge_map."

Assumptions:

 - All challenge steps have a "Next Step #{link}" as the final line of the file - sorry rubocop.
 - The order is in the challenge map
 - the challenge map is called "00_challenge_map.md"
 - the challenge .md files are on the same level in the same folder as the challenge map.
 - the github address of the repo is passed as an argument to the method.
 - the challenge_map file has no indentation.


 LINK ORDER:
 1. mefirst.md
 2. mesecond.md
 3. ozymandias.md
 4. shhhnonames.md
